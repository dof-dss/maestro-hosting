# Departmental provider configuration.
#
# To use this provider you will need to add a personal Platform.sh token to your environment vars (.env)
# The Key should be 'PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN' and the token can be generated from 'My Profile' -> 'API Tokens'.
#
# Usage: ddev pull dept
# This will take a snapshot of your current database and import both the Drupal and Migration databases.
# Files will not be imported as the file system for Departmental is around 100GB.
